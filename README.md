## üîç Project Overview
This end-to-end machine learning project:
- Processes customer service data from the [Telco Churn Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)
- Identifies key churn indicators (contract type, tenure, services used)
- Predicts churn probability with **85%+ recall** (minimizing false negatives)
- Deploys an interactive web app for business teams

**Business Impact**: Potential to reduce churn by 20-30% through targeted interventions.
